            <p style={{ color: 'black' }} class="card-text text-center">
              We began our journey by building a retro game console powered by the ESP32 microcontroller. Our aim was to create a device that merged the charm of retro gaming with modern technology. As we developed, we shared our progress and code openly on GitHub, allowing others to join in and contribute.

              Over time, we incorporated IoT capabilities, enabling our console to connect to the internet and retrieve game data, solving memory constraints. One of our unique innovations is an intuitive game design tool on our website, empowering users to create custom game visuals effortlessly.</p>

              Our product is built for hands-on experimentation with software technologies and applications. We leverage electronic components, software systems, and an open framework that invites user collaboration.

              Our ultimate goal is to teach users the fundamentals of algorithms and game design, while helping them develop real-world application skills. With Playard, every user becomes an active participant in pushing the boundaries of what's possible in gaming and technology.</p>
